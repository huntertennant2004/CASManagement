# CASManagement
CASManagement is an application designed not only to help students under the IB Diploma record their CAS (Creativity, Action, Service) hours and detail their experiences, but also for supervisors overseeing these students record their personal reviews for each of the students. Upon opening the application, you will be asked to either sign up, or log in to an existing student/supervisor. Login details are stored in a text document. Once logged in, users can create a new record of an event (if a student) or a review (if a supervisor). You can also edit and delete existing records. Once you are happy with your record, clicking on "PUBLISH" with a record selected will format and write it to a new text file, which you can be stored for future use. I invite you to try and find bugs in the program, for example creating two accounts with the same username.
